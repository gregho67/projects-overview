# About me

I am a Computer Science engineer, specialized in app and games development. I graduated from the Computer Science and game development Master of the Strasbourg University 2 years ago. My Master's cursus, called Master of Engineering in Computer Science (Image, Virtual Reality, Interactions and Games Track), focuses on learning and using multiple programming languages and softwares designed mainly to work on images, 3D environments and video games. During those 5 years I worked on many school projects involving different types of skills and knowledges, specifically centered on the topic of my Master's cursus. I also developped some personnal projects on my free time to learn how to create video games of different genres.

# Personnal projects

## Animes/games quiz app

After participating in a local game jam, I was inspired by a group that made a great game using the engine Godot, which I never tried before. This made me want to try it and so I decided to create a small app to pick up this new software. The app features multiple quizes for different animes and games and offers different modes. I'm currently developping it for mobile, but I intend to make it accessible as a web app too.

This app is still in developpment and I will soon post screenshots of it, as well as a playable version and the progress I'm making, so stay tuned !

## 2D Mobile Game

This is a project I started during my third yearin college, to try and learn mobile game developpment on Unity. This is a 2D game with an 8-bit style. The player can shoot arrows by tapping on the screen and he has to shoot the ennemies to gain points while being careful not to touch innocents with his projectiles.

I made some of the assets for this game and used or modified some other free assets that I found mostly on [OpengameArt](https://opengameart.org/). The game itself is complete since it's playable on multiple mobile devices, but I haven't had the time to add all the content I originally planned on adding, such as a in-game shop or other types of ennemies.
